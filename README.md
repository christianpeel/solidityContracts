# solidityContracts
Example Ethereum contracts using the Solidity Language

The Ethereum Mix IDE and other Solidity development tools are still pretty rough.  These 
contracts are very simple yet show some of the functionality of the Mix IDE.  See this
[tutorial](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Mix:-The-DApp-IDE) for an introduction and 
the [github repo](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/) to get Mix and related tools.
